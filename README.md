# win-2nd-teams-instance-launcher

Teams 2nd Instance launcher is a tool for launching second instance of Microsoft Teams client in Windows easily.
If you need to run two Teams clients simultaneously with two accounts or you want to launch second instance with the same account, this is THE solution for you.  

You can compile binary yourself or download compiled binary from download page: https://publicwi.fi/launcher or directly: https://publicwi.fi/launcher/Teams2ndInstance_1_0.zip

This is "Minimum viable product", if bugs are found, create issue here and I try to solve it when I have time.
